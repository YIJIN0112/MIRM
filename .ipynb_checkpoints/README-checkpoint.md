## Intro
This project proposes an enhanced recommendation model based on SVD and multi-interest learning text enhancement based on the research of Lin's team. The dataset used in this study is the MovieLens dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). Besides, movie synopsis information was additionally included on top of ML-1M through IMDb's API and finally applied to model training.
